            <p>
            Blood bank is a place where blood bag that is collected from blood donation events is stored in one place. The term “blood bank” refers to a division of a hospital laboratory where the storage of blood product occurs and where proper testing is performed to reduce the risk of transfusion related events . The process of managing the blood bag that is received from the blood donation events needs a proper and systematic management. The blood bag must be handled with care and treated thoroughly as it is related to someone’s life. The development of Web-based Blood Bank Management System (BBMS) is proposed to provide a management functional to the blood bank in order to handle the blood bag and to make entries of the individuals who want to donate blood and who are in need.

            Over the years, blood banking has helped save countless lives. Most blood banks, including the American Red Cross, rely on volunteer blood donors. During a typical blood donation, about 1 pint of blood is collected, along with a few small tubes for testing. The tubes and donation are labeled with donor information and sent off for processing and testing.Next, the donated blood is taken to the processing center. Whole blood is usually centrifuged, which separates it into its many components that patients may need: red blood cells, platelets and plasma. White blood cells are removed from the blood to minimize the chance of a reaction in the recipient.While the donation is being processed, the blood test tubes are sent out for screening. At the American Red Cross, this includes testing for diseases such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV and West Nile Virus. If any of the tests are positive, the donor will be notified and the blood will not be used.
During the testing stage, the blood is also typed for ABO groups and Rh factor. Once the blood is screened and processed, it is stored up to 42 days or until it is needed. A blood bank ensures that hospitals have a safe, reliable blood supply for patients in need. You can help meet supply demands by scheduling your donation today. Your donation may even help save more than one life.        </p>

            <h4>Donor Tips</h4>
            <p>
                Blood donation is a voluntary procedure that can help save lives. There are several types of blood donation. Each type helps meet different medical needs.  
            </p>
            <p>
            Whole blood donation is the most common type of blood donation. During this donation, you donate about a pint (about half a liter) of whole blood. The blood is then separated into its components — red cells, plasma and sometimes platelets.
            </p>
            <p>
            <strong>Eligibility requirements:</strong>
            <br>
            <br>
 To be eligible to donate whole blood, plasma or platelets, you must be:<br>
<ul>
<li>In good health.</li>
<li>At least 16 or 17 years old, depending on the law in your state. Some states allow legal minors to donate with parent permission. While there's no legal upper age limit, policies may vary between individual donor centers.</li>
<li>At least 110 pounds (about 50 kilograms).</li>
<li>Able to pass the physical and health-history assessments.</li>
<li>Eligibility requirements differ slightly among different types of blood donation.</li>

            <p>
            <strong>Food and medications:</strong><br>
            <br>
Before your blood donation:<br>
            
<ul>
<li>Get plenty of sleep the night before you plan to donate.</li>
<li>Eat a healthy meal before your donation. Avoid fatty foods, such as a hamburger, fries or ice cream.</li>
<li>Drink plenty of water before the donation.</li>
<li>Check to see if any medications you are taking or recently took would prevent you from donating. For example, if you are a platelet donor, you must not take aspirin for two days prior to donating. Talk to a member of your health care team before you stop taking any medications in order to donate blood.</li>
<li>Wear a shirt with sleeves that can be rolled up.</li>

        <p><strong>After the procedure:</strong><br>
            <br>
After donating, you sit in an observation area, where you rest and eat a light snack. After 15 minutes, you can leave. After your blood donation:<br>
<ul>
<li>Drink extra fluids.</li>
<li>Avoid strenuous physical activity or heavy lifting for about five hours.</li>
<li>If you feel lightheaded, lie down with your feet up until the feeling passes.</li>
<li>Keep your bandage on and dry for the next five hours.</li>
<li>If you have bleeding after removing the bandage, put pressure on the site and raise your arm until the bleeding stops.</li>
<li>If bruising occurs, apply a cold pack to the area periodically during the first 24 hours.</li>
<li>Consider adding iron-rich foods to your diet to replace the iron lost with blood donation.</li>
